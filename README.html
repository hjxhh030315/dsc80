            <h1 id="sugars-influence-on-recipe-ratings-an-investigation-into-variance-differences">Sugar's Influence on Recipe Ratings: An Investigation into Variance Differences</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this analysis, we explore the influence of nutritional components and recipe complexity on user ratings within a comprehensive dataset of recipes. This dataset not only details each recipe's name and preparation time but also enriches our study with a breakdown of nutritional content—specifically focusing on sugar, protein, and the total number of ingredients. By establishing a model to predict recipe ratings based on these variables, we aim to uncover patterns that may suggest how certain nutritional aspects and recipe complexity influence user preferences and ratings. This exploration seeks to provide insights into the dietary preferences that resonate most with users, potentially guiding healthier or more appealing recipe modifications</p>
<p>We are given two dataset for our project, <code>recipes.csv</code> and <code>interaction.csv</code></p>
<h4 id="recipes-datasets">Recipes Datasets:</h4>
<p><code>name</code>: The name of the recipe. Useful for identification and user-friendly outputs in analysis.</p>
<p><code>id</code>: Unique identifier for each recipe. Key for linking with user ratings and reviews.</p>
<p><code>minutes</code>: Time required to prepare the recipe. This variable can be used to analyze time preferences in recipe ratings.</p>
<p><code>contributor_id</code>: User ID of the individual who submitted the recipe. Allows us to track submissions by user but is less relevant for predictive modeling.</p>
<p><code>submitted</code>: The date when the recipe was posted. Not directly used in rating predictions but helpful for understanding trends over time.</p>
<p><code>tags</code>: Keywords associated with the recipe from <a href="http://Food.com">Food.com</a>, indicating cuisine, dietary considerations, and other descriptors that might influence user preferences.</p>
<p><code>nutrition</code>: An array containing nutritional values such as calories, total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and carbohydrates (all as percentage of daily value, PDV). Sugar and protein are of particular interest as predictive variables.</p>
<p><code>n_steps</code>: The number of steps required to make the recipe. This can be an indicator of complexity and might affect user ratings.</p>
<p><code>steps</code>: Detailed textual instructions for preparing the recipe. While verbose, text analysis could uncover insights into complexity and clarity’s effect on ratings.</p>
<p><code>description</code>: A brief user-provided summary or description of the recipe, which could influence a user's decision to try or rate the recipe.</p>
<h4 id="ratings-dataset">Ratings Dataset:</h4>
<p><code>user_id</code>: Identifier for the user providing the rating. Useful for personalized analysis but not directly used for overall rating predictions.</p>
<p><code>recipe_id</code>: Connects the rating to the specific recipe in the Recipes dataset.</p>
<p><code>date</code>: When the rating was posted. Provides temporal insights but typically not used in basic rating predictions.</p>
<p><code>rating</code>: The score given to the recipe by a user. This is the target variable for your predictive model.</p>
<p><code>review</code>: Textual review accompanying the rating. Potential for sentiment analysis and its correlation with numeric ratings.</p>
<h3 id="exploring-culinary-preferences-through-data">Exploring Culinary Preferences Through Data</h3>
<p>Our project utilizes a detailed dataset from <a href="http://Food.com">Food.com</a>, encompassing a diverse range of recipes each tagged with comprehensive attributes like preparation time, nutritional values, and user-generated content including ratings and reviews. Key features such as the sugar and protein content of recipes are extracted from nutritional information to predict how these factors influence recipe ratings. Each recipe is also described through its preparation steps, number of ingredients, and tags that help categorize the recipe by cuisine and style. Through our analysis, we aim to reveal trends and preferences in recipe ratings, offering insights into what makes a recipe popular among users, with a special focus on protein, sugar, and number of ingredients.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="data-cleaning-and-exploratory-data-analysis">Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="data-cleaning">Data cleaning</h3>
<p>In the analytical section of our report, we meticulously merged and cleaned the recipe data to prepare it for a comprehensive analysis of how sugar and protein content influence recipe ratings. Initially, we combined the recipes dataset with the ratings dataset using the <code>recipe_id</code> as the key to link each recipe to its corresponding reviews and ratings. This allowed us to align the nutritional information directly with user feedback.</p>
<p>Following the merge, our focus shifted to extracting crucial nutritional components—sugar and protein—from the <code>nutrition</code> list embedded within each recipe record. The <code>nutrition</code> attribute contained a list of values, where sugar and protein were positioned as the third and fifth elements respectively.</p>
<p>Utilizing Python’s list indexing, we extracted these elements to form new, dedicated columns for each nutritional metric. This data extraction was crucial as it enabled us to specifically analyze the impact of these nutrients on the recipes' ratings.</p>
<p>There is an overview of the dataset after cleaning</p>

<h3 id="univariate-analysis">Univariate Analysis</h3>
<p>To ensure the quality and reliability of our data, we conducted a preliminary analysis using a box plot to visualize the distribution of sugar content across recipes. The original visualization revealed a wide range of values, with some extreme outliers stretching far beyond typical culinary sugar amounts. In response, we adjusted the plot to focus on a more typical range, setting the x-axis limit to 300 grams. This adjustment made it apparent that the majority of sugar values clustered well below this threshold, indicating that values above 300 grams were rare and not representative of typical recipes</p>
<iframe src="./imgs/sugar_box_before.html" width="90%" height="600px" frameBorder=0></iframe>
<p>From this refined box plot, we concluded that recipes containing sugar amounts within the observed range (0 to just below 300 grams) were most relevant for further analysis, while those exceeding 300 grams were considered outliers and excluded from predictive modeling. This decision was based on the rarity of such high sugar values and aimed at enhancing the accuracy and applicability of our predictive insights, focusing on dietary habits that are more common and representative of typical consumer choices. By maintaining this focus, we ensure that our findings remain relevant and practical for typical culinary applications and dietary considerations.</p>
<iframe src="./imgs/sugar_box_after.html" width="90%" height="600px" frameBorder=0></iframe>
<p>Similar to our approach with sugar, we analyzed the distribution of protein content in recipes, setting a threshold at 200 grams to exclude outliers. This decision ensures our analysis remains focused on typical dietary recipes, excluding extreme high-protein dishes that are not standard in everyday meals. Our goal is to provide insights that are applicable to the average consumer, enhancing the practical value of our findings.</p>

<h3 id="bivariate-analysis">Bivariate Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="interpreting-the-scatter-plot-for-sugar-and-rating">Interpreting the Scatter Plot For Sugar and Rating</h4>
<p><strong>Distribution Trends</strong>: The scatter plot reveals that as sugar content varies, the ratings mostly cluster between 4.2 and 4.6. There doesn't appear to be a clear trend or pattern indicating a strong linear relationship between sugar content and average ratings, as the data points are quite spread out horizontally.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Correlation</strong>: The lack of a visible upward or downward trend suggests that there may not be a strong direct correlation between sugar content and recipe ratings. However, this does not rule out other forms of relationship or underlying factors that could influence these variables.</p>
<p><strong>Outlier Consideration</strong>: Even with the sugar cutoff at 300 grams, the plot shows some spread in ratings at various sugar levels, but there are no extreme outliers in sugar content that distort the analysis. This supports your decision to limit sugar content to 300 grams in your analysis.</p>

<h4 id="interesting-aggregation">Interesting Aggregation</h4>
<h3 id="what-we-did">What We Did:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We divided recipe ratings into three categories:
<ul>
<li>Low Ratings: Ratings ≤ 3.5</li>
<li>Medium Ratings: Ratings between 3.5 and 4.5</li>
<li>High Ratings: Ratings &gt; 4.5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grouped and Aggregated Data:
<ul>
<li>We grouped the data by these rating categories and calculated the average sugar and protein content for each group. This created a pivot table showing the average nutritional content for each rating category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interpreted the Results:
<ul>
<li>Using the pivot table, we analyzed trends in sugar and protein content across the three rating categories.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-we-found">What We Found:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sugar Content
<ul>
<li>Recipes with low ratings had the highest average sugar content (45.17 grams).</li>
<li>Recipes with medium ratings had least sugar on average (38.88 grams).</li>
<li>Recipes with high ratings had the slightly lower average sugar content (41.54 grams).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Higher sugar content may negatively influence ratings. Users might prefer recipes with less sugar, potentially because they are perceived as healthier or more balanced in flavor.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protein Content:</p>
<p>The average protein content was fairly consistent across categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low Ratings: 34.25 grams</li>
<li>Medium Ratings: 33.47 grams</li>
<li>High Ratings: 31.84 grams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Protein content does not appear to have a significant impact on recipe ratings. The variation in protein levels across rating categories is minimal.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-of-missingness">Assessment of Missingness</h2>
<p>We begin by identifying which columns in the dataset contain missing values. Note that that the missing values are not a result of the merging process, as we previously used an inner join to combine the <code>recipes</code> and <code>interaction</code> dataframes</p>

<h3 id="nmar-analysis">NMAR Analysis:</h3>
<p>During our analysis, we identified that some recipes lack reviews and we believe that will be NMAR. Our investigation suggests that this missingness could potentially relate to the recipes' complexity or popularity, indicating that it might not be random. For instance, users might choose not to leave a review for recipes they didn’t enjoy, as negative experiences could discourage them from engaging further with the platform. Similarly, recipes that are particularly complex, requiring many steps or unusual ingredients, might also go unreviewed. This could happen because users may abandon these recipes partway through or feel that their feedback wouldn’t be constructive. Additionally, some users might avoid leaving reviews for recipes they didn’t personally prepare but simply viewed, resulting in gaps in the data tied to these specific scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="missingness-dependency">Missingness Dependency:</h3>
<p>We run 1000 permutation test on the column <code>n_steps</code> based on the following Hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong>: The distribution of <code>n_steps</code> is the same for recipes with missing review and without missing review</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong>: The distribution of <code>n_steps</code> is different between recipes with missing review and without missing review, thus <code>review</code> is NMAR depends on <code>n_steps</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And we use <strong>Absolute Difference in Mean</strong> as our test statistics</p>
<iframe src="./imgs/missingness.html" width="90%" height="600px" frameBorder=0></iframe>
<p>From both plot intepretation and numerical calculation</p>
<p>We get <strong>P-value</strong> of 0.0 for our permuation test. This means we reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of <code>n_steps</code> is the same for recipes with missing review and without missing review.</p>
